# Machine Learning Algorithms 

This repository is a personal project where I **implement machine learning algorithms from scratch** (and sometimes with libraries) to deepen my understanding of the field.  
The goal is to **practice, learn, and experiment** with core concepts of machine learning by coding them step by step.

---

##  Project Goals
- Strengthen my understanding of machine learning fundamentals  
- Implement algorithms manually instead of only relying on frameworks  
- Experiment with datasets and practice applying models  
- Build a collection of algorithms as a learning resource  

---

##  Implemented / Planned Algorithms
-  Linear Regression  
-  Logistic Regression  
-  Decision Trees
-  k-Means Clustering  
-  k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)  
-  Principal Component Analysis (PCA)   
-  Neural Networks (basic)  

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python üêç  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn 

---

##  Future Plans
- Add more advanced algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Deep Learning)
- Compare manual implementations with scikit-learn equivalents
- Write short explanations for each algorithm
